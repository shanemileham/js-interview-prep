Delete Middle Node:
Implement an algorithm to delete a node in the middle
(i.e., any node but the first and last node, not necessarily the exact middle)
of a singly linked list, given only access to that node.
EXAMPLE
Input: the node c from the linked list a->b->c->d->e->f
Result: nothing is returned, but the new linked list looks like a->b->d->e->f

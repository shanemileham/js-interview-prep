Animal Shelter:
An animal shelter, which holds only dogs and cats, operates on a strictly"first
in, first out" basis. People must adopt either the "oldest" (based on arrival
time) of all animals at the shelter, or they can select whether they would
prefer a dog or a cat (and will receive the oldest animal of that type). They
cannot select which specific animal they would like. Create the data structures
to maintain this system and implement operations such as enqueue, dequeueAny,
dequeueDog, and dequeueCat. You may use the built-in Linked L is t data
structure.

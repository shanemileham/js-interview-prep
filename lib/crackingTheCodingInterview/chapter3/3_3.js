Stack of Plates:
Imagine a (literal) stack of plates. If the stack gets too high, it might
topple. Therefore, in real life, we would likely start a new stack when the
previous stack exceeds some threshold. Implement a data structure SetOfStacks
that mimics this. SetOfStacks should be composed of several stacks and should
create a new stack once the previous one exceeds capacity. SetOfStacks. push ()
and SetOfStacks. pop () should behave identically to a single stack (that is,
pop ( ) should return the same values as it would if there were just a single
stack).
FOLLOW UP
Implement a function popAt(int index) which performs a pop operation on a
specific sub-stack.

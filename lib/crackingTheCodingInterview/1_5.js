/*
One Away:
There are three types of edits that can be performed on strings:
insert a character, remove a character, or replace a character. Given two
strings, write a function to check if they are one edit (or zero edits) away.
EXAMPLE
pale, pIe -> true pales. pale -> true pale. bale -> true pale. bake -> false
